# Project_Python_Markdown_HTML

This tool converts any markdown file into HTML to do a static site builder.

What is a static website ?
A static website is a site only composed of files in a folder:

- HTML files,
- CSS files,
- JavaScript files,
- pictures,
- videos,

This is opposed to dynamic websites, where some of these files are generated on the air by software, for example from data in a database.


# Host a static site
Hosting a dynamic site is more complex than for a static site, it is indeed necessary to install the software that will generate the files on the air. But on the other hand, hosting a static site is relatively simple, you just have a small web server that provides the folder containing static files.

#Github
Github provides free static site hosting. Just create a git repository with Github, and commit to a specific branch. Your site is then accessible at the following address: https://your_login.github.io/your_name_of_depot/
